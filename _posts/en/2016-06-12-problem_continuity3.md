<div>
Study the continuity of the following function: <br><br>

$\displaystyle g(x) = (\arcsin(x))^3$<br><br>

<div class="bcblue boxdissap">
Solution
</div><br>

<div class="dissap">
This function is a trigonometric one. We need to take into account that we can not do the arcsin of a number greater than 1 or lower than -1, both included ($x\leqslant|1|$).<br><br>
 
To determine whether the function is continuous or not, we can ignore the power of the arcsin because it will not affect the result. Therefore, this function is continuous when $x\epsilon[-1,1]$ <br><br>
