<div>
Study the continuity of the following function: <br><br>

$\displaystyle h(x) = (x^3)·\tan(3x+2)$<br><br>

<div class="bcblue boxdissap">
Solution
</div><br>

<div class="dissap">
First, this function is a product of a polynomial (continuous function) and a tangent function (which is not continuous when $3x +2 = \dfrac{\pi}{2}$).<br><br>
Therefore, we need to know what is the value for $x$ in order to get $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ inside the tangent. We do a first order equation:<br><br>
$3x +2 = \dfrac{\pi}{2}$<br><br> 
$x = \dfrac{\pi - 4}{6}$<br><br>
When $x$ takes this value, then the tangent does not exist and the function neither. <br><br>
Therefore, the function is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ except when $x$ takes the value  $\dfrac{\pi - 4}{6} + 2·\pi)·k$ where $k$ belongs to the integer numbers (it is the number of periods). <br><br>
